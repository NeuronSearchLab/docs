Contexts describe the placement, audience, and intent behind a recommendation request. Properly configuring them keeps results relevant across your product surfaces.

## When to create a new context

Create a dedicated context whenever:

- The UI surface has unique layout or business goals (homepage vs. detail page).
- You need a different blend of filters, boosts, or fallback logic.
- You want to measure performance separately from other experiences.

Start with a handful of high-impact contexts, then expand as you identify more nuanced placements.

## Configure contexts in the console

1. Navigate to [Console â†’ Contexts](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com/contexts).
2. Click **New context** and provide an ID such as `homepage` or `checkout_cross_sell`.
3. Set optional defaults:
   - **Filters** to enforce inventory rules.
   - **Boosts** to promote seasonal items or campaigns.
   - **Diversity controls** to avoid repetitive recommendations.
4. Save the configuration and share the context ID with your engineering team.

## Reference contexts in API calls

Attach the context ID to every recommendation request so NeuronSearchLab can apply the proper logic.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.neuronsearchlab.com/recommendations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode "user_id=user-123" \
  --data-urlencode "context_id=homepage"
```

The context you choose also appears in analytics, allowing you to compare conversion rates and engagement across placements.

## Iterate continuously

Monitor performance metrics and adjust context settings as business goals evolve. Combine live experimentation with [event tracking](/api-reference/endpoint/submit-events) to ensure the learning loop stays tight.
