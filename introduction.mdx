## Welcome to NeuronSearchLab

NeuronSearchLab is a modern, developer-first recommendation engine that helps you deliver intelligent, personalized content to your users - at scale.

It is a fully managed service - not something you deploy yourself - and it integrates easily with your existing backend or frontend using our API, SDK, and web console. Whether you are recommending content, products, videos, or anything else, NeuronSearchLab adapts to your data and business goals.

### Why teams choose NeuronSearchLab

- ‚ö° **Real-time recommendations** - Low latency vector search tuned for personalization use cases.
- üß† **Contextual intelligence** - Dynamically filter and boost results using metadata, rules, and user behavior.
- üîê **Secure access** - Built-in authentication, scoped API keys, and multi-tenant controls to keep data safe.
- üîÑ **Embeddings on demand** - Generate, store, and upsert embeddings through a single pipeline.
- üìà **Event-driven learning** - Capture clicks, views, and conversions to continuously improve ranking quality.

### How the platform fits together

1. **Model your catalog** - Send descriptive metadata and optional embeddings for every item you want to recommend.
2. **Capture real-world signals** - Stream events from your applications so the service can learn what resonates.
3. **Request recommendations** - Query the API or SDK for tailored content that respects your contexts and filters.
4. **Monitor and iterate** - Use dashboards, alerts, and analytics to tune performance over time.
