NeuronSearchLab uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials to authenticate server-to-server requests. Follow these practices to protect your integration.

## Create API clients

1. Visit [Console → Security → API Clients](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com/security/clients).
2. Click **New client** and provide a descriptive name per application or environment.
3. Download the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Store the secret in a secure vault—never ship it to browsers or mobile apps.

## Exchange credentials for an access token

Use the client credentials to request a short-lived access token.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.neuronsearchlab.com/auth/token \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

Tokens default to a 60-minute lifetime. Cache them server-side and refresh proactively to avoid downtime.

## Authenticate SDK requests

The official SDK handles token exchange automatically. Provide credentials once during initialization:

```ts
import { NeuronSearchLab } from '@neuronsearchlab/sdk';

const client = new NeuronSearchLab({
  clientId: process.env.NEURON_CLIENT_ID!,
  clientSecret: process.env.NEURON_CLIENT_SECRET!,
});
```

The SDK refreshes tokens in the background and retries transient errors with exponential backoff.

## Protect secrets in production

- Scope clients per environment (staging, production) to limit blast radius.
- Rotate credentials regularly using your secrets manager.
- Audit token usage through the console activity logs.

For endpoint-specific authentication details, refer to the [API Reference introduction](/api-reference/introduction).
