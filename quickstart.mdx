## Set up your access

NeuronSearchLab is a hosted API service that provides real-time personalized recommendations through an API, SDK, and a web console. You don’t need to deploy or install anything — just sign up and generate your API credentials.

### 1. Register or Log In

Go to [console.neuronsearchlab.com/register](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com/register) or [login](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com/login) to create an account.

### 2. Generate Client Credentials

Once logged in, navigate to the **Security** section and generate a new **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. These are required to authenticate your backend services.

<Warning>
  **Do not expose your Client Secret on the frontend.**
</Warning>



---

## Authenticate securely

Set up a backend endpoint in your server to authenticate with the NeuronSearchLab API:

1. Call the `/auth/token` endpoint using the Client ID and Client Secret from your server.
2. Pass the resulting access token to your frontend application (e.g. via HTTP-only cookies or headers).
3. Use this token to access NeuronSearchLab endpoints such as `/recommendations`, `/items`, and `/events`.

```bash
POST /auth/token
Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>
```

---

## Make your first API call

Once you have an access token, you can start making calls to the API:

```bash
GET /recommendations?user_id=user-123&context_id=homepage
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

Use the [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neuronsearchlab/sdk) for easier integration with JavaScript apps, or call the API directly from your backend.

---

## Explore the Console

In addition to the API and SDK, you can manage your data and monitor performance through the [NeuronSearchLab Console](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com). This includes:

- Creating recommendation contexts
- Reviewing event logs
- Managing item catalogs
