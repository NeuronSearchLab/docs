## Set up your access

NeuronSearchLab is a hosted API service that provides real-time personalized recommendations through an API, SDK, and a web console. You do not need to deploy or install anything - just sign up and generate your API credentials.

### 1. Register or log in

Go to [console.neuronsearchlab.com/register](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com/register) or [login](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com/login) to create an account. You can invite teammates later from the **Organization** settings page.

### 2. Generate client credentials

Once logged in, open **Security** → **API Clients** and create a new client. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. They are required to authenticate your backend services.

<Warning>
  **Never expose the Client Secret in browser code or mobile apps.** Store it in your server-side environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

### 3. Add your first dataset

Navigate to **Catalog** → **Items** and use the upload flow to add a handful of representative items. Include metadata such as category, price, tags, and thumbnails to improve downstream recommendations.

---

## Authenticate securely

Create a backend route that exchanges your client credentials for an access token. The token scopes enforce what each service can do.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.neuronsearchlab.com/auth/token \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(client_id:client_secret)>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

1. Call the `/auth/token` endpoint from a trusted server environment.
2. Cache the resulting access token until it expires (tokens default to 60 minutes).
3. Forward the token to your frontend or edge workers via secure headers.

<Tip>
  Rotate credentials regularly and prefer one client per application so you can revoke access without downtime.
</Tip>

## Make your first API call

With an access token you can request recommendations immediately. The following example retrieves homepage content for a known user:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.neuronsearchlab.com/recommendations?user_id=user-123&context_id=homepage" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>"
```

Send optional query parameters such as `limit`, `filters`, or `boosts` to tailor the response. Responses include ranked items with associated metadata so you can render UI components quickly.

If you prefer higher level abstractions, install the [official SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neuronsearchlab/sdk) and call `client.recommendations.list()` from your server.

## Explore the console

In addition to the API and SDK, you can manage your data and monitor performance through the [NeuronSearchLab Console](https://console.neuronsearchlab.com). Key areas include:

- **Contexts** - Define business rules, default filters, and ranking objectives.
- **Events** - Inspect incoming engagement signals and replay payloads for debugging.
- **Catalog** - Search and edit item metadata to keep recommendations fresh.
- **Insights** - Track conversion metrics, latency, and popular queries over time.
