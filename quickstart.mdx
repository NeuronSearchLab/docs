## Set up your development environment

Get started quickly by setting up your local environment and deploying your documentation or API integration.

### Edit and preview locally

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs or project repo">
    Your project repository contains everything you need to get started with NeuronSearchLab. Clone it locally using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
    ```

    Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, and navigate into your project directory to begin editing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes locally">
    Use your preferred development server to preview documentation or test API changes in real time. If using a framework like Next.js or Vite, you can run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    You should now see your site running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Set up continuous deployment">
    We recommend using GitHub Actions, Vercel, or Netlify for deploying your docs or frontend. Once configured, pushing changes to your main branch will automatically trigger a deployment.
    
    For backend components (e.g. Lambda functions), you can use the AWS CDK or SAM CLI to deploy changes to your infrastructure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes to deploy">
    After committing your changes, push them to your remote repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update docs"
    git push origin main
    ```

    Your deployment pipeline should automatically pick up the latest changes and update your documentation or services.
  </Accordion>

## Update your docs and API references
