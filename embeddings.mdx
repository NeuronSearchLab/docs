Embeddings transform your items and users into dense vectors so NeuronSearchLab can calculate semantic similarity beyond simple keyword matches.

## When to provide embeddings

NeuronSearchLab automatically generates baseline embeddings for common content types. Supply your own when:

- You have domain-specific language or metadata that generic models miss.
- You need to encode business features that influence ranking.
- You already operate an in-house embedding service and want to reuse it.

## Upload embeddings with items

Add embedding payloads to the [`POST /items` endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/submit-items). Each item can include multiple vectors tagged by `embedding_set`.

```json
{
  "item_id": "article-123",
  "title": "How to launch a personalization strategy",
  "metadata": { "topic": "personalization" },
  "embeddings": [
    {
      "embedding_set": "semantic_v1",
      "vector": [0.12, -0.04, 0.88, ...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Generate embeddings on demand

If you prefer not to manage embeddings yourself, call the hosted generator endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.neuronsearchlab.com/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "input": "How to launch a personalization strategy",
        "embedding_set": "semantic_v1"
      }'
```

Use the response vector immediately or persist it alongside future item upserts.

## Keep embeddings fresh

Regenerate embeddings when you substantially update item content or release new embedding sets optimized for your use case. Monitor recommendation performance to determine the right refresh cadence.
